# PaDiM-Anomaly-Detection
A simple script of padim provides an easy way to achieve anomaly detection 

## Installation:  

●python=3.6  
●torch=1.4.0  
●opencv-python=4.2.0.34  

## Introduction of the run_padim.py:

1. Take efficientnet for instance, the result of feature maps are shown as below:

2. To consider different threshold and run for efficientnet, the result of masks are shown as below. Note that NG sample should be included in test folder for proper normalization of score map:
